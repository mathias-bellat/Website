# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am mainly interested in archaeological sciences and all their aspects, whether methodological or philosophical. My main research topic is currently geosciences applications in archaeology with machine learning and soil sciences methodologies. I am also interested in Near East Neolithic archaeology and, more significantly, earthen construction materials study under the microscope and other archaeometrics techniques.
